# Nuke Build System Setup Complete

## Summary

I have successfully added a Nuke build project to your KafkaConfluentCloud solution with the following components:

### 🏗️ Build Project Structure
- **`build/Build.csproj`** - Nuke build project using .NET 9.0 and Nuke 9.0.4
- **`build/Build.cs`** - Main build script with all build targets
- **`build/README.md`** - Detailed documentation for the build system
- **`.nuke/`** - Nuke configuration directory
- **`build.sh`** - Convenient shell script wrapper

### 🎯 Available Build Targets

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `clean` | Removes build artifacts (bin/obj folders) and cleans artifacts directory |
| `restore` | Restores NuGet packages for the solution |
| `format` | Formats code using `dotnet format` |
| `build` | Builds the solution |
| `test` | Runs all tests in the solution |
| `publish` | Publishes API and Service projects to artifacts directory |
| `all` | Complete pipeline: Clean → Restore → Format → Build → Test → Publish |

### 🚀 Usage Examples

```bash
# Run complete build pipeline
./build.sh all

# Individual targets
./build.sh clean
./build.sh restore
./build.sh format
./build.sh build
./build.sh test
./build.sh publish

# With specific configuration
./build.sh build --configuration Release
./build.sh all -c Release

# Show help
./build.sh --help
```

### 📁 Output Structure
- Published applications are output to `artifacts/` directory
- Each project gets its own subdirectory (e.g., `artifacts/KafkaProducer.Api/`)
- Artifacts directory is already ignored in `.gitignore`

### ✅ Verification
All targets have been tested and are working correctly:
- ✅ Clean target removes build artifacts
- ✅ Restore target restores NuGet packages
- ✅ Format target formats code (with minor warnings that don't affect functionality)
- ✅ Build target compiles the solution successfully
- ✅ Test target runs (no test projects found, which is expected)
- ✅ Publish target creates deployable artifacts
- ✅ Complete pipeline executes all steps in correct order
- ✅ Configuration parameter works (Debug/Release)

### 🔧 Solution Integration
- Build project added to `KafkaConfluentCloud.sln`
- Build project excluded from solution build to prevent circular dependencies
- Compatible with .NET 9.0 and uses latest Nuke version (9.0.4)

### 📚 Documentation
- Comprehensive README in `build/README.md`
- Built-in help system in `build.sh --help`
- IDE integration support for Visual Studio, Rider, and VS Code

The build system is now ready for use in development, CI/CD pipelines, and production deployments!
